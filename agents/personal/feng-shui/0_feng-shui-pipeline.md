# Feng Shui Room Evaluation Pipeline

Below is a step-by-step pipeline that a Feng Shui consultant would 
follow when evaluating a room. You can copy and paste this directly 
into your documentation.

## 1. Initial Consultation
- **Clarify Purpose & Goals**  
  - Ask the client how they use the room (e.g., bedroom, office, living room).  
  - Define what they’d like to improve (health, wealth, relationships, productivity).
- **Discuss Constraints**  
  - Budget, timeline, any structural limitations.

## 2. Data Gathering
- **Collect Plans & Photos**  
  - Obtain (or sketch) a floor plan with precise dimensions.  
  - Take photos from each corner, doorways, windows, and any architectural features.
- **Note Room Orientation**  
  - Use a reliable compass or digital app to find true north.  
  - Record the facing direction of doors and windows.

## 3. External & Environmental Scan
- **Building Context**  
  - Assess the building’s shape, entrances, and neighboring structures.
- **Surroundings**  
  - Note nearby roads, water features, hills—anything that channels or blocks Qi.

## 4. Bagua & Sector Mapping
- **Overlay the Bagua**  
  - Align the Lo Shu magic square or Western 9-sector Bagua over the floor plan, based on the main entrance.
- **Identify Life Areas**  
  - Mark which zones correspond to Wealth, Fame, Love, Family, Health, Creativity, Knowledge, Career, and Helpful People.

## 5. Qi-Flow Analysis
- **Energy Pathways**  
  - Trace how Qi enters (front door, windows) and circulates through the space.
- **Commanding Positions**  
  - Locate key vantage points (e.g., bed, desk, stove) and ensure they “command” the door view while backed by a solid wall.

## 6. Five-Element & Yin-Yang Balance
- **Element Audit**  
  - Check presence and proportion of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water in each Bagua sector.
- **Yin-Yang Harmony**  
  - Evaluate lighting, materials, and textures for proper Yin (soft, dark, quiet) and Yang (bright, hard, active) balance.

## 7. Diagnose “Sha Qi” & Imbalances
- **Clutter & Blockages**  
  - Identify obstacles that impede Qi (clutter, closed pathways).
- **Negative Influences**  
  - Spot poison arrows (sharp corners aimed at seating), stagnant corners, or conflicting element groupings.

## 8. Remedies & Enhancements
- **Cures**  
  - Introduce Elemental adjustments:  
    - **Water** (mirrors, fountains) to nourish Wood or Career areas.  
    - **Metal** (bells, sculptures) to refine and focus.  
    - **Wood** (plants, wooden objects) for growth and vitality.  
    - **Fire** (candles, lamps) for fame and passion.  
    - **Earth** (crystals, ceramics) for stability and relationships.
- **Color & Material Suggestions**  
  - Align palette and textures with each sector’s element.
- **Furniture & Layout Tweaks**  
  - Reposition pieces to open pathways and create supportive back-up.

## 9. Implementation Planning
- **Phasing**  
  - Prioritize high-impact, low-effort changes first.
- **Sourcing & Budgeting**  
  - List recommended items (plants, mirrors, art) with cost estimates.
- **Client Guide**  
  - Provide a simple checklist for self-maintenance and seasonal tweaks.

## 10. Follow-Up & Tuning
- **Review Visit** (4–6 weeks later)  
  - Observe how the changes have influenced energy and client satisfaction.
- **Adjustments**  
  - Fine-tune element placements or introduce additional cures as needed.
- **Long-Term Monitoring**  
  - Offer seasonal or annual check-ins to keep Qi flowing in harmony.
